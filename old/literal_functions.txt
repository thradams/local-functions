ABSTRACT

   This proposal introduces literal functions into the C language,
   offering a syntax for defining functions at the point of use. Literal
   functions allow programmers to define small, local functions  without
   requiring separate file-scope declarations.
   

1.  INTRODUCTION

   C currently lacks a mechanism to define functions at the point of 
   usage which leads to:

   -    Reduced code locality, forcing readers to jump between unrelated 
        parts of a source file.

   -    The file scope may become cluttered with functions and 
        associated struct declarations used to support captures.
        

2.  MOTIVATION

   Many standard C library functions (e.g., 'qsort', 'thrd_create') and
   common APIs rely on callbacks.  Today, using them requires extra 
   boilerplate, especially for asynchronous callbacks.
   
      static int cmp(const void *a, const void *b) {
         int arg1 = *(const int*)a;
         int arg2 = *(const int*)b; 
         return (arg1 > arg2) - (arg1 < arg2);
      }

      qsort(arr, n, sizeof(int), cmp);

   With literal functions, the programmer could write:

      qsort(arr, 20, sizeof(int), (int (const void *a, const void *b) {
         int arg1 = *(const int*)a;
         int arg2 = *(const int*)b; 
         return (arg1 > arg2) - (arg1 < arg2);
      });

   Asynchronous callbacks would have a huge improvement in clarity. 
   Consider this sample:

      void async(void (*callback)(int result, void * data), void * data);
      
      struct capture { int value; };
                
      static void async_complete(int result, void * data) {
         struct capture * capture = data;
         free(capture);
      }
      
      int main() {
         struct capture * capture = calloc(1, sizeof * capture); 
         async(async_complete, capture);
      }

   Given the current state of the language, the function async_complete,
   which is used only once, must be declared at file scope.  Since it 
   uses the struct capture, that struct also needs to be declared at 
   file scope.

   With the introduction of function literals, we can declare the struct
   capture and async_complete (that does not need a name anymore) inside
   the local scope.

      void async(void (*callback)(int result, void* data), void * data);

      int main()
      {
         struct capture { 
            int value; 
         }* capture = calloc(1, sizeof * capture); 

         async((void (int result, void * capture)) {
            struct capture * p = capture;
            free(p);
         }, capture);
      }

   Sample using thrd_create

      int main()
      {
         thrd_t t;

         int r = thrd_create(&t, (int (void * data)) {
            printf("Hello world!\n");
            return 0;
         }, NULL);
  
         if (r == thrd_success)
            thrd_join(t, NULL);
         
         return 0;
      }

3.  SYNTAX AND SEMANTICS

   3.1 Syntax
 
      postfix-expression: 
         ...      
         literal-function     
  
      literal-function:
         ( type-name ) function-body 
 

   * The type-name shall have a function type. 

   Note:
      The syntax is ambiguous with that of a compound literal. 
      Disambiguation is performed based on the type: only literal 
      functions may have a function type, whereas compound literals 
      shall not.
   
   Note:
      Function-specifiers (_Noreturn, inline) and storage-class 
      specifiers (auto, constexpr, extern, register, static, 
      thread_local, typedef) are not permitted in literal function,
      as their semantics are not currently defined in this context.

   3.2 Semantics
   
      * The literal function is a function designator (6.3.3.1)
      
         void main()
         {      
            (void (*pf)(void)) = &(void (void)){}; //ok
                   
            //error: lvalue required as left operand of assignment
            &(void (void)){} = 0; 
         }

   
      * Identifiers from the enclosing scope, excluding labels, 
        are visible inside the literal function.

      Samples:

         int main() {      
            enum E {A};
            int i = 0;
            (void (void)) {
               int j = sizeof(i); //ok
               enum E e = A; //ok
            }();
         }


         int main() {      
            L1:;
            (void (void)) {
               //error: label 'L1' used but not defined
               goto L1; 
            }();
         }
 
      * For literal functions, __func__ is defined following the same 
        rules as for non-literal functions. The value of __func__ is 
        an implementation-defined null-terminated string when used 
        inside literal functions.

        Note: For comparison, C++ lambdas returns "operator ()" 

   3.3  CONSTRAINS
      
      * The name of an object of automatic storage duration defined in 
        an enclosing function shall be referenced only in discarded 
        expressions.

      Samples:

         int main() {
            int i = 0;
            (void(void)){ i = 1; /*error*/ }();
         }

         int main() {
           int i = 0;
           (void(void)){ int j = sizeof(i); /*ok*/ }();
         }

         int g;
         int main() {
            (void(void)){ g = 1; /*ok*/ }();
         }

         int main() {
            int f();
            (void ()){ f(); /*ok*/}();      
         }

         int main() {
            static int i = 0;
            (void ()){ i = 1; /*ok*/ }();      
         }

      * Variably modified (VM) types defined in an enclosing scope shall
        not be referenced

         int f(int n) {
            int ar[n];
            (void ()){ typeof(ar) b; /*error*/ }();      
         }

       * An identifier declared outside the body or parameter list of a 
         literal function has the enclosing scope (block or file scope). 
         An identifier declared within the parameter list of a literal 
         function has block scope, which is the literal function body 
         itself. These rules are consistent with those already in 
         effect. See 6.2.1.

      Sample:

         int main() {
            (struct X { int i; } (struct Y *y)) {
               struct X x = {};
               return x;
            }(nullptr);

           struct X x; //ok
           struct Y y; /*error*/
         }

4.  GENERIC FUNCTIONS

   A literal function may result in the instantiation of distinct 
   functions depending on the arguments provided.  For example:

      #define SWAP(a, b)\
       (void (typeof(a)* arg1, typeof(b)* arg2)) { \
         typeof(a) temp = *arg1; *arg1 = *arg2; *arg2 = temp; \
       }(&(a), &(b))

      int main() {
         int a = 1;
         int b = 2;
         SWAP(a, b);
      }


      #define NEW(...)\
       (typeof((__VA_ARGS__))* (void)){\
          typeof(__VA_ARGS__)* _p = malloc(sizeof * _p);\
            if (_p) *_p = __VA_ARGS__;\
            return _p;\
      }()

      struct X { const int i; };

      int main() {
         auto p2 = NEW((struct X) {});
      }         

5.  RATIONALY

   Literal functions improve the C language without introducing new 
   concepts, providing more flexibility to functions and enabling a form
   of generic functions in C.

   5.1  Why not C++ lambdas syntax?
   
      Maintaining the existing C grammar is the safest option, as it 
      ensures that function literal syntax stays in sync with function
      declarations and naturally preserves compatible scope rules

      Consider this sample:

         int main() {
            (struct X { int i; } ()) {
               struct X x = {};
               return x;
            }();
           struct X x = {}; /*ok*/
         }

      The scope rules for the visibility of struct X are the same as 
      those for functions. With the C++ lambda syntax, the return type
      would be specified after the parameter scope, which could 
      interfere with scope handling or complicate the implementation.

      This design also leaves room for alternative capture models that
      do not follow the C++ approach. Having different models with the
      same syntax could be confusing for users.
      
      Interoperability using a pair of pointer to function + data is 
      possible in both directions, from C to C++ and from C++ to C,
      when captureless lambdas are used.

   5.2  Why not having captures like C++ lambdas?

      When lambdas were introduced in C++, the language already included
      the necessary infrastructure for capturing such as exceptions, 
      constructors, destructors, and function objects.  In contrast, C 
      lacks these features.
   
      Low-level alternatives in C would conflict with existing available 
      patterns, while high-level abstractions might require introducing
      new concepts that may not fit well in C.

      Automatic capture of constexpr objects, or constant objects 
      declared with the register storage-qualifier, from the other 
      scope were considered. This limitation can be removed in the 
      future if necessary.
      
      Note: For comparison, C++ lambdas without captures can use 
      constexpr objects, provided their addresses are not taken.

6.  COMPATIBILITY AND IMPACT

   * This feature does not break any existing valid C programs, since
     compound literal objects of type function cannot be created in the
     current C version. 


7.  IMPLEMENTATION CONSIDERATIONS

   Literal functions can be implemented by the compiler as:

   * Anonymous 'static' functions with unique internal names.

   * Emission of a unique function symbol in the object file.

   7.1 Recommended practice

      * Identical literal functions, having the same function type and 
        function-body should, but they are not required, to produce the
        same function.

   7.1 Existing implementations

      Cake transpiler has an implementation that converts C2Y code to
      C99.
      http://thradams.com/cake/playground.html  

      C++ lambda expressions without captures serve as prior art for 
      this feature, albeit with some differences.
